Here's a step by step on how to use our web weather forecast

1. Open the visual studio code
   Double-click the index.html file in your project folder.
   The app will open in your web browser.
2. Search for a City
   At the top, you’ll see a search bar.
   Click on the input box and type the name of the city you want to check the weather for (for example: London, Tokyo, or New York).
3. Get the Weather
   Press the Search button or just hit Enter on your keyboard.
   The app will fetch the latest weather data for your chosen city.
4. View the Results
   You’ll see the current temperature and a short description of the weather (like “clear” or “cloudy”).
   Below, you’ll also see a simple 5-day forecast for that city.
5. Try Another City
   Want to check another place? Just type a new city name and search again!
So that's it! There's no installation and no sign up. Just open and search your location.
